How to run:
Just run "daneel-ai" to start the bot and make it connect to a server
running on localhost. Use the --help option to find out other usage options.

What it does:
The bot keeps track of small facts, like "contains(0,10)" to represent the
universe. It also has a collection of rules to deduce new knowledge and
approriate actions from these facts.
The current ruleset can be found in the "rules-rfts" file. It implements a
bot that tries to build 1 scout each turn and sends these scouts to random
places. It also builds 1 colonist each turn and will build a transport once
5 colonists are ready to move. It then sends out these transports to planets
it has discovered but doesn't own yet.
More background information on the rule system can be found on the wiki:
